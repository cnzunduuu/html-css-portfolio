**My First Portfolio Page README.md**


This project is a personal portfolio website built as a foundational learning exercise in HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to apply core concepts of web development, including semantic HTML, basic styling, and version control.

**Project Goal**
The primary objective of this project is to solidify my understanding of HTML and CSS by building a fully functional, multi-section portfolio page from scratch.

**Tutorial and Resources**
This project was built with the guidance of the following tutorial:

* Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Slxdo0Dqxlk 

Resources:

* https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-git-basics 
* https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_portfolio_gallery.asp 
* https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_download.asp 
* https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ 

**My Customisations**
While the core structure and concepts follow the tutorial, I have made the following personal modifications to make this project my own:

* Custom Colour Palette: I have selected a unique, high contrast colour palette to give the website a personal and distinct aesthetic.
* Google Fonts Integration: I am using a custom font from Google Fonts to enhance the typography and visual design.
* Personal Content: The website features my own photographs, a custom bio, testimony, my personal projects and contact information.
* Skills section: I will be including a skills section but instead of images for the icons, I will be using icons from Font Awesome and contain my experience level with the different languages.
* Downloadable CV: I will also be adding the option to have a PDF copy of my CV/resume to be available to be downloaded.
* Accessibility First: I am consciously implementing key accessibility features, such as ARIA labels and a "Skip to Content" link, to ensure the website is usable for a wide range of users.

**Tech Stack**

* Languages: HTML, CSS
* Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code
* Deployment: GitHub Pages

**Future Improvements**

As I build up my skillset, in particularly with JavaScript, I plan to revisit this project with the following improvements: 

* Add responsive design to ensure accessibility across all devices.
* Integrate light/dark theme toggle for accessibility and preference.
* Experiment with basic JavaScript interactivity (e.g. animations, form validation).
* Expand the portfolio with future projects.


**Learning Reflections**
This project has been an excellent opportunity to put theory into practice. It has helped me gain confidence in using foundational web technologies and has reinforced my belief that I can successfully build a great future in computer science.
